**All the debugs in this program are the following**

1. Instead of class attribute to the <p> tags, I used span.day and span.time instead
2. New and Date() is two different objects. they need to be separated.
3. the showDate object which represents the span.day, must be declared, without the .innerHTML method
4. innerHTML -> O, innerHtml -> X 
5. showDate object represents only the object, not the innerHTML. so when assigning any of the array string value, innerHTML property is needed to be declared
6. to use string literal, instead of "" or '' we need to use `` back ticks.
7. the name of the id, class, name etc. when passing as a paramenter to document objects, we must pass it as  a string.
8.To constantly update the time, I've implemented the following ->
-firstly, put all the code inside updateTime() function
-secondly, I called the setInterval() function and passed the updateTime function and set the interval every 1000 milli seconds.
-lastly, called the initial updateTime() function so that it activates or starts with the loading body of html.
